almond `0.3.0` was just released.
This release contains mostly updates, but also notable changes in the build
of almond, that can be of interest to you!

## Updates

This release switches to [Ammonite](https://ammonite.io) `1.6.3`, and
[ammonite-spark](https://github.com/alexarchambault/ammonite-spark) `0.3.0`.
Apart from a few internal changes, these were mostly maintaince releases.

There were some minor binary incompatible changes in those,
justifying the minor version bump here.

## One-liner to run from sources

The previous "run from sources" instructions relied on publishing almond
locally, then generating a coursier boostrap to run the locally published
artifacts. This was a bit cumbersome overall, requiring running commands
both inside sbt and outside of it.

The almond build now defines sbt tasks making it more practical.
These allow to run almond from sources in just one command, like
```bash
$ sbt jupyterStart shell
```

See the [install from sources page](https://almond.sh/docs/dev-from-sources.html#setup)
for more details.

## New front page

The almond website now has a shiny [new front page](https://almond.sh).
It draws inspiration from the numerous docusaurus users out there, most
notably the scalameta projects. Thanks to them!

## almond-spark for scala 2.12

The `almond-spark` module is now published for scala 2.12, so that one can
rely on it from an almond kernel running scala 2.12, when using spark 2.4.0.

## Docker images

Docker images for almond, based on
[official Jupyter images](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks),
are now automatically generated and pushed upon each Almond release.
These are based on [previous work](https://github.com/Atry/almond-images)
by [@Atry](https://github.com/Atry), and live in
[this repository](https://github.com/almond-sh/docker-images).

For example you can run almond `0.3.0` with
```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 almondsh/almond:0.3.0
```
Then copy the token from the Jupyter logs, and head to `http://localhost:8888`.
